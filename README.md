# Matic Maniac

Matic Maniac is a project build Gitcoin Grants Round 10 Hackathon as a submission for Polygon GR10 Hackathon Bounties, specifically the Degenscore on Polygon challenge. Built in collaboration between @OmniAnalytics and @ControlCplusControlV it allows anyone to check the score of their wallet, which is a composite based on the number of protocols and tokens their wallet has interacted with. Interacting with both tokens and DeFi will increase your score, while interacting with something for the first time can help you earn achievements. Experiment with Polygon and all it has to offer to discover all the achievements!
